# Project Title: Self-record Attendance System

## Project Description
The following title is called the **Self-record Attendance System**, which aims to reflect the objectives and targets of the project. Manual attendance requires a significant amount of time to check students' attendance. On the other hand, the automated attendance in the campus (e.g., the QR) is systematic, but the QR terminals can handle only one student at a time. Multiple QR terminals may help, but the campus has hundereds of students. Thus, the amount of time accomodating the student's attendance is still significant.

The proposed attendance system aims to develop an attendance platform that improves the efficiency of attendance recording. Students will be able to record their own attendance rather than a person or a scanner. At the same time, the system will have features to prevent dishonest or falsified attendance entries.

Examples of features planned in the project are a login and logout system, attendance tracker creation/checking, time-based attendance checking, settings, and notifications. The program will additionally provide messages when a user has invalid inputs, which will assist the user in the UX (user experience) of the program

The main goals of the attendance system are to:

• Allow students to record their own attendance, mainly in classes.

• To ensure that the system verifies the inputs and outputs properly, so there’s no dishonest recording.

In short, the following proposed attendance platform plans to provide a transparent and efficient attendance system to address the current limitations of traditional and semi-automated attendance systems.

## Features
• Login and Log Out feature

• (Creating, Viewing, or Filling out) Attendance

• System time utilization for attendance punctuality 

• Settings feature

## How to run the program
1A. Ensure that Python is installed in your program. This can be done by running either of the following lines in your command prompt or terminal:

  `python --version`
  
  `python3 --version`

The minimum Python version possible to run the program is Python 3.7, but the recommended Python version used for running the program is Python 3.9+.

If Python is not installed in your program, or the current Python version in the Python program is older than Python 3.7, it is downloadable from `Python.org`.

1B. Ensure that Tkinter and bcrypt are installed in your program. This can be checked by running the following code on a command prompt or terminal:

Command Prompt (cmd): `python -m tkinter` for Tkinter, and `pip show bcrypt` for bcrypt

Terminal: `python3 -m tkinter`for Tkinter, and `python3 -c "import bcrypt"` for bcrypt

If either of the following libraries is missing, they can be downloaded by running the following lines on a command prompt or terminal:

cmd: `pip install tkinter` for Tkinter and `pip install bcrypt` for bcrypt

terminal: `brew install python-tk` for Tkinter and `pip3 install bcrypt` for bcrypt

2. Download the file `Self-record Attendance.py`, or copy-paste the code from it and paste it into a Python file.

3. Open a terminal or command prompt.

4. Run the program by pressing F5 or clicking 'Run.' 

5. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter login authentication, options for attendance, etc.
