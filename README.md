# Project Title: Self-record Attendance System

## Project Description
Our project is called the **Self-record Attendance System**. The main reason we chose this is because taking attendance still has a lot of problems. Manual attendance takes too much time since someone has to check everyone. On the other hand, the automated attendance in our campus (like the QR) is faster, but one terminal can only accomodate one student at a time. Even if there were multiple terminals, its unsurprising that there would still be lines of students waiting.

With our project, we want to make an attendance system that can make things easier and faster. Students will be able to record their own attendance instead of depending on just one person or one scanner. At the same time, the system will have features to avoid cheating, so students can’t just “fake” their attendance.

Some features we plan to add are a log in and log out system, attendance tracker creation/checking, time-based attendance checking, settings, and notifications. The program will also give messages when a user enters something wrong, so it’s clear and easy to use.

Our main goals are:

To allow students to record their own attendance. (By classes)

To make sure the system checks the inputs and outputs properly so there’s no dishonest recording.

Overall, this project will try to solve the problems of slow and unreliable attendance systems while making the process more fair and organized.
