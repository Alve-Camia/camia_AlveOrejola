What do you mean by this? 
"On the other hand, the common automated attendance in the campus (QR) can only focus
on checking attendance for one student every time, reducing the speed. This is more apparent when it is tracking attendance for a larger number of people, such as a batch. "
	Of course, there is only 1 terminal currently being used. That is the only terminal in use.  
	If there are like 10 terminals, then many students can be accommodated synchronously.
	What strategy are you suggesting to speed up attendance tracking?
