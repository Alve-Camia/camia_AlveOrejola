Project title: Automated Attendance System 

Problem Statement: 
  When it comes to attendance, there is still a use of manual and automated attendance tracking. Though it has reasonable efficiency, issues still arise from it. For attendance involving manual tracking, this method of attendance over relies on one or more people to check the attendance. On the other hand, the common automated attendance in the campus (QR) can only focus on checking attendance for one student every time, reducing the speed. This is more apparent when it is tracking attendance for a larger number of people such as a batch. 
  For this automated attendance system project, we will attempt to make an attendance system that addresses the following issues said earlier, ideally by allowing one to record their attendance and send it to the person handling it. However, features will be needed to avoid dishonest attendance recording. That way, the finished project would have less loopholes and prevent academic dishonesty (In this situation, “cheating” on attendance). 

Project Objectives:
•	Allow students to record their attendance instead of relying on a single person/object to do so.
•	Consider input/output validation in attendance system to prevent dishonest attendance recording   
Planned Features: 
•	User(s) logging in and out of the project product through a database
•	Option to (create/check, record) an attendance tracker
•	Feature that utilizes the current time for checking attendance 
•	Settings feature 
Planned Inputs and Outputs:

(User) Input: Successfully logging into the program
(System) Output:
• Display options for Attendnce tracking options and account settings
• Display current time 

(User) Input: Chooses the option to create an attendance tracker
(System) Output:
• Asks user to enter attendance tracker name, when to start and stop checking attendance and method of attendance (e.g, QR code, pin/password).
(Example for start and stop checking attendance format: MM, DD, YYYY, from [Start Time] to [End Time]
• Additionally asks user whether they want to modify attendance tracker 
• Show user a preview of what their attendance trakcer (for attendee point of view)

(User) Input: Checking attendance trackers (Made by the user)
(System) Output:
If user hasn't made any attendance trackers:
• Program displays "No current attendance trackers you've made.
Otherwise:
• Program displays current attendance trackers made by user

(User) Input: Checks overview of attendance tracker:
(System) Output:
Program displays the following:
• Attendance tracker status (Not started, Ongoing, Ended)
• Attendee entries and info (e.g, account name, time of attendance tracked)
• Option to give comments from attendee entries
