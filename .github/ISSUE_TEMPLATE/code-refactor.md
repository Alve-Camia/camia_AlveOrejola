Code Refactor Description:

Short Description/Summary of what certain code needs refactoring

Goal:

What is the desired outcome after refactoring the code?


[ ] Improve code readability

[ ] Improve maintainability

[ ] Reduce complexity

[ ] Improve performance

[ ] Remove duplication

[ ] Prepare for new feature

[ ] Other: 


Scope:

Specify the files, modules, components, or code snippets involved

Current Issue:
What makes the current implementing of the specified code require refactoring?

[ ] High Cyclomatic Complexity (Certain Method doing too many things)

[ ] Code Duplication (Code is similar to another piece of code)

[ ] Poor Naming  (Non-descriptive, vague, or misleading names)

[ ] Large Class or Function (Class/Function violates SRP - Single Responsibility Principle)

[ ] Tight coupling (Certain codes are too dependent on each other)

[ ] Performance bottleneck (Code is inefficient - Slows down the system)

[ ] Technical debt (Code was made only for short-term gain, makes future changes difficult)

[ ] Other:

Proposed Approach:

Insert possible solution/s to refactor the code

Expected benefit:

[ ] Reduced technical debt

[ ] Improved maintainability

[ ] Better performance

[ ] Easier feature additions

[ ] Cleaner architecture

Additional Context:

Insert additional context (things to note) about or when optimizing the code
